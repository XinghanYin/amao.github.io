			<h1>display advertising</h1>
			<p>The premise behind traditional advertising disintegrated years ago. Why&rsquo;s that? Because pretty much everyone has come to the same conclusion: it&rsquo;s intrusive, annoying and a royal waste of time. But thanks to savvy internet marketeers, we&rsquo;re now plagued with banner ads and interstitial videos. Are they effective? Do they attract traffic or clutter UX? There&rsquo;s no real consensus, but one thing&rsquo;s certain &ndash; regardless of where they appear, digital ads are a vital (and often lone) revenue stream for many apps and websites. And while standardisation, exchange programmes and rich media may have made them a bit less unattractive for advertisers and audiences, the whole approach still feels like little more than a modernised throwback to an outdated ad strategy.</p>

		<h5>"Engagement is only possible now because brands are waking up to the fact they can engage with their consumers in a meaningful way. And that doesn&rsquo;t come through a 30-second spot. That doesn&rsquo;t come through a radio ad. It doesn&rsquo;t come through outdoor billboards. It comes through creating content your audience enjoys." &ndash; Amao, CEO of Amaotec</h5>
